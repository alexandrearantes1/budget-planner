# Budget Planner

The Budget Planner is a personal budget tool designed to be a quick and straightfoward way to control personal finances without the hurdles of a spreadsheet. 

The app was designed with easy of use in mind, it is fully responsive to work on a variety of mobile devices and it was inspired by the Budgety Project from the JS course from https://codingheroes.io.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to deliver a fully implemented and responsive front-end web application to help people who wish to better manage their finances, plan a budget for an event or party. 

The app was designed to be intuitive, easy and quick to use, displaying live updates to the budget as you add each transaction. 

## Target Audience

This website was targeted to any person who needs to create and manage a simple budget with income and expenses when subcategories are not necessary. A personal monthly budget or an event's budget would be good examples of use.

## Features

The Budget Planner consists of a header containing the logo, the summary information which displays the current month and year, the total income, total expenses and net income.

Below the header there is a form that allows the user to add transactions to the budget. The form contains 4 elements: one toggle to switch the transaction type between income and expense, one input text field for the description, one for the value, and a button to submit.
